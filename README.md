# bscDUCO
BscDUCO is a token that allows transferring duino-coin (the only arduino-mineable cryptocurrency) to Binance Smart Chain (BSC) for pancakeswap trades and more stuff.


### How does that work ?
For each circulating bscDUCO, one DUCO is stored in [a custody account](https://explorer.duinocoin.com/?search=bscDUCO).
